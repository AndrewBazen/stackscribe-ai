A value type can be one of the two following kinds:

- a [structure type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct), which encapsulates data and related functionality
- an [enumeration type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/enum), which is defined by a set of named constants and represents a choice or a combination of choices

## Built-in Value Types
C# provides the following built-in value types, also known as _simple types_:

- [[Integral Numeric Types]]
